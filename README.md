# `aimacode` Project Ideas


We are looking for students to work on `aimacode` for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (GSoC). We don't know for sure if `aimacode` will be accepted, or how many students we will be allowed to sponsor, but here are some project ideas:

## Finish aima-python algorithms and add explanatory notebooks

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms in Python: we have [a list](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/README.md) of half a dozen algorithms yet to implement, and a dozen still requiring tests. For this we're looking for coders with good taste: the code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode in the book. 

In addition to that, we would like to add ipython (jupyter) notebooks that exaplain how to use the algorithms, and show their application to specific domains, demonstrating both how to use the code, and how the underlying AI ideas work. The notebooks should also inspire the reader to try out nerw ideas of their own. This requires coding skills, but also English writing skill and good educational pedagogy.

## aima-java

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms, and add documentation and examples of usage. The code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode in the book.

## aima-javascript

Here we're not interested in showing javascript code, but rather in having interactive graphical demonstrations. So this role is for someone who can write javascriot, but more importantly someone with good graphic design sense, and an ability to invent good educational material.

## aima-exercises

This is a new project: build a web site (on githiub) for the exercises that were in the AIMA book for the third edition, but will be only online in the fourth edition. That means we  need a student to help with some or all of these tasks:

- Translate the current exercises (in LaTeX) into markdown.
- Create some new, high-quality exercises.
- Host all those exercises on github, both in raw file form, and hopefully as pretty [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Create an encouraging community for volunteers to write new exercises and solutions and correct/augment old ones.
- Design a system where students can vote/rank exercises.
- Figure out a way to have the answers for some exercises hidden (so that professors can assign them as homework) and have the answers for others (and discussion forums) available for the community.


# Your Application

If you are interested in applying as a GSoC student, you should:
- Say which of the above areas you are interested in working on.
- Say what your experience is, including pointers to some projects you've worked on.
- Bonus points if you've contributed to `aimacode` already: look for an open issue and pitch in.
- You don't need a detailed proposal saying what specific things you want to do within an area.
