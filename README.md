# aima-gsoc


We are looking for students to work on `aimacode` for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (GSoC). We don't know for sure if `aimacode` will be accepted, or how many students we will be allowed to sponsor, but we're interested in these four main areas:

## aima-python

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms, and add documentation and examples of usage in ipython notebooks. The code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode.

## aima-java

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms, and add documentation and examples of usage. The code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode.

## aima-javascript

Here we're not interested in showing javascript code, but rather in having interactive graphical demonstrations. So this role is for someone who can write javascriot, but more importantly someone with good graphic design sense, and an ability to invent good educational material.

## aima-exercises

This is a new project: build a web site (on githiub) for the exercises that were in the AIMA book for the third edition, but will be only online in the fourth edition. That means we  need a student to help with some or all of these tasks:

- Translate the current exercises (in LaTeX) into markdown.
- Create some new, high-quality exercises.
- Host all those exercises on github, both in raw file form, and hopefully as pretty [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Create an encouraging community for volunteers to write new exercises and correct/augment old ones.
- Design a system where students can vote/rank exercises.
- Figure out a way to have the answers for some exercises hidden (so that professors can assign them as homework) and have the answers for others (and discussion forums) available for the community.


# Your Application

If you are interested in applying as a GSoC student, you should:
- Say which of the above areas you are interested in working on.
- Say what your experience is, including pointers to some projects you've worked on.
- Bonus points if you've contributed to `aimacode`.
