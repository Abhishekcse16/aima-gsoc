# aima-gsoc


We are looking for students to work on `aimacode` for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) (GSoC). We don't know for sure if `aimacode` will be accepted, or how many students we will be allowed to sponsor, but we're interested in these four main areas:

## aima-python

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms, and add documentation and examples of usage in ipython notebooks. The code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode.

## aima-java

Finish the implementation of the pseudocode algorithms, and add documentation and examples of usage. The code needs to work, of course, but it also needs to be easy for the reader to understand, and to have a very close (almost one-to-one) correspondance to the pseudocode.

## aima-javascript

Here we're not interested in showing javascript code, but rather in having interactive graphical demonstrations. So this role is for someone who can write javascriot, but more importantly someone with good graphic design sense, and an ability to invent good educational material.

## aima-exercises

This is a new project: build a web site (on githiub) for the exercises that were in the AIMA book for the third edition, but will be only online in the fourth edition. We want to have all the exercises available to students and teachers, and have a system where new exercises can be added by volunteers. As the GSoC student, you would set an example by adding high-quality exercises.

# Your Application

If you are interested in applying as a GSoC student, you should:
- Say which of the above areas you are interested in working on.
- Say what your experience is, including pointers to some projects you've worked on.
- Bonus points if you've contributed to `aimacode`.
